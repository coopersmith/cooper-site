### Data

Nobody captured my 2024 listening data better than last.fm. I remain surprised and delighted that this service continues to exist, let alone invest in things like a [2024 year end roundup](https://www.last.fm/user/coopersmith/listening-report/year) that I found far more insightful and interesting than those produced by Spotify, Apple Music, etc.
