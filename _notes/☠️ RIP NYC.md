"You are a New Yorker when what was there before is more real and solid than what is here now." [[The Colossus of New York]]

This is an ever growing list of the places I've known, and often loved, that have closed in my 15 years in NYC. The list heavily biases towards the Williamsburg and Greenpoint neighborhoods, given thats where I spent my first decade in the city (2010-2021).

## Eulogized

**Red Star**  
_Date Closed: ~2014 · Now: Nothing_  
Not sure I could ever capture the magic that was Red Star. My friends lived nearby and were in here 3-4 times a week for any big (or medium) sporting event. At my peak, I'd join 1-2x a week. On nights where there was a NYC team playing, there'd be a weird crowd. Other nights, we'd have the bar to ourselves. Wings were incredible. Beer would just keep coming out. And the tab at the end of the night was always 1/5th of what it should have been. I'll never have a place like this again in my life. It was perfect.

This place needed to close for obvious reasons. But that doesn't mean I don't still have dreams about that burger and shoestring fries. I used to love arriving before my friends and heading upstairs for a hand drawn beer at the bar.

**Spuyten Duyvil**  
_Date Closed: Unknown · Now: Unknown_  
While I never learned how to pronounce the name, I absolutely loved coming here, especially while waiting for a table at St. Anselm's. You could put your name in for a delicious steak, wander two doors down, and sit in the backyard. Best part was that when your table was ready, you could carry your beer through the backyard to your table.

"The pared-down lineup of drafts—as well as its 100-plus bottle list, focused mainly on tiny European breweries—at this pioneering Williamsburg bar spoke to owner Joe Carroll's reverence for beer. ("With too many lines, the beer can sit around and get stale," he said.) Alas, Spuyten poured its last brewski in April 2024 due to rising rents."

**Reynard**  
_Date Closed: 2020-03 · Now: Le Crocodile_  
Reynard came before the reniassance in high end hotel restauraunts. While I went for both brunch and dinner, the brunch was absolutely fantastic, mostly because of the breakfast sandwich, which was basically a burger, and it was fantastic.

**Brooklyn Star**  
_Date Closed: [2018](https://ny.eater.com/2018/5/7/17328678/brooklyn-star-nyc-closing-williamsburg) · Now: Unknown_  
Sunday night supper of country fried steak or fried chicken was one of my favorite places to gather with friends. Admitedly, when I looked up its closure, I was surprised to see it was open until 2018. I think I last visited in mid 2014.

**Fort Defiance**  
_Date Closed: Unknown · Now: Unknown_  
Before Lyft, Uber, and Citibike, getting to Red Hook felt like an absolute adventure. Fort Defiance was the reward at the end of the journey. Moved on to The bar closed for good in December 2023, with owner St. John Frizell focusing his efforts on Gage & Tollner and its upstairs cocktail bar, the Sunken Harbor Club.

_Date Closed: Unknown · Now: Unknown_
We’ll always remember the burgers at Gabriel Stulman’s gastropub, an intimate 28-seat corner spot in the West Village. It was a place that felt like it catered to locals as much as diners there on a first date.
