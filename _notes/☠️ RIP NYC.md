"You are a New Yorker when what was there before is more real and solid than what is here now." [[The Colossus of New York]]

This is an ever growing list of my favorite spots in NYC that have closed.


### Red Star 
Not sure I could ever capture the magic that was Red Star. My friends lived nearby and were in here 3-4 times a week for any big (or medium) sporting event. At my peak, I'd join 1-2x a week. On nights where there was a NYC team playing, there'd be a weird crowd. Other nights, we'd have the bar to ourselves. Wings were incredible. Beer would just keep coming out. And the tab at the end of the night was always 1/5th of what it should have been. I'll never have a place like this again in my life. It was perfect.

### Spotted Pig
This place needed to close for obvious reasons. But that doesn't mean I don't still have dreams about that burger and shoestring fries. I used to love arriving before my friends and heading upstairs for a hand drawn beer at the bar. 

Donna
During the golden era of Williamsburg, Donna was one of the spots to be. https://www.instagram.com/p/CKb5QU7lxWe/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
