"You are a New Yorker when what was there before is more real and solid than what is here now." [[The Colossus of New York]]

This is an ever growing list of my favorite spots in NYC that have closed.

## Eulogized

**Red Star**  
_Date Closed: ~2014 · Now: Nothing_  
Not sure I could ever capture the magic that was Red Star. My friends lived nearby and were in here 3-4 times a week for any big (or medium) sporting event. At my peak, I'd join 1-2x a week. On nights where there was a NYC team playing, there'd be a weird crowd. Other nights, we'd have the bar to ourselves. Wings were incredible. Beer would just keep coming out. And the tab at the end of the night was always 1/5th of what it should have been. I'll never have a place like this again in my life. It was perfect.

This place needed to close for obvious reasons. But that doesn't mean I don't still have dreams about that burger and shoestring fries. I used to love arriving before my friends and heading upstairs for a hand drawn beer at the bar.

During the golden era of Williamsburg, Donna was one of the spots to be. https://www.instagram.com/p/CKb5QU7lxWe/?

**Reynard**  
_Date Closed: 2020-03 · Now: Le Crocodile_
Reynard came before the reniassance in high end hotel restauraunts. While I went for both brunch and dinner, the brunch was absolutely fantastic, mostly because of the breakfast sandwich, which was basically a burger, and it was fantastic.

**Brooklyn Star**

While I never learned how to pronounce the name of this bar, I absolutely loved coming here, especially while waiting for a table at St. Anselm's. You could put your name in for a delicious steak, wander two doors down, and sit in the backyard. Best part was that when your table was ready, you could carry your beer through the backyard to your table.

**Dumont**  
_Date Closed: 2014-01 · Now: Unknown_

**Fort Defiance**  
_Date Closed: Unknown · Now: Unknown_
Before Lyft, Uber, and Citibike, getting to Red Hook felt like an absolute adventure. Fort Defiance was the reward at the end of the journey.
