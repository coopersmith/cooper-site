## Highlights
- He became intoxicated by the engagement offered to him, and like with so many other hardcore tweeters, the platform became his addiction. The difference between him and the other diehards chasing the constant dopamine rush of Twitter, however, was that he had the means to capture his addiction and the desire to remake it in his own image.

- He had assumed Twitter was a knot of technical issues that a great engineering mind like himself could easily untangle, enabling the growth of free speech in the digital town square. But at its core, Twitter was plagued by social and political dilemmas, not merely technological ones. ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0CW1GBZ6Z&location=235))

- Twitter executives were taken with the idea of labeling, no one more so than Dorsey, who was fed up with the pressure from Congress and the public over misinformation. His company had no business becoming an arbiter of truth, he thought, and it was in an untenable position in a polarized political climate where the idea of truth itself was contested. Labels allowed Twitter to avoid taking down anyone’s speech wholesale. Every day felt like another fire drill, and Dorsey was becoming inured to it. The approach of labeling some risky tweets let Twitter protect its reputation—it was doing something about misinformation—without needing to fact-check every single questionable post or overstepping into censorship of unverified content.
