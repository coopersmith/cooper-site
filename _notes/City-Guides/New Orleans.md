With no disrespect to Cleveland, I feel this. There's truly no city in America, or anywhere else in the world, like New Orleans. It's where we go when we need a trip that feels like escaping to a 

Below, please find a list of all my favorite places, as well as a suggested itinerary. 

Number of visits: 4
Most recent visit: September, 2024

## Stay

**Hotel St. Vincent** - A fantastic way to get out of the French Quarter. This feels like the spiritual successor the Ace, but one that grew with me into adulthood. Absolutely fantastic pool, though the lounge chairs are a bit limited and therefore competitive (some folks get there at 8am to start reserving). 

## Breakfast

**Hotel St. Vincent** - I'm 

**Willa Jean** - Might be a little long in the tooth these days, but a great place to soak up the booze 

**Cafe du Monde** - A New Orleans institution for their beignets. Not exactly what I would call breakfast, but widely popular. Avoid the one in the French Quarter and head to the one in City Park, combined with a visit to the New Orleans Museum of Art.

## Lunch

**Turkey and the Wolf** - one of the best lunches you’ll ever have. Fried Bologna sandwich is a top 5 sandwich of my life. Find someone to go splitty/split on the burger (Closed Mon/Tues)

**Cochon Butcher** - Good spot for lunch if you need a break from Po Boys 

### Po Boys 

**Parker’s** and **Domicils -** Widely regarded and debated as the two best po boys in the city. We had both and our verdict is: Yes. They’re both incredible. 

**Mothers Po Boys -** Centrally located in the CBD, usually a very long line. I believe its possible to order ahead

**Kiler Po Boys** - Po Boys with a bit of a bann mi twist


  

  

## Dinner

- **Mosquito Supper Club** - This is my favorite meal in New Orleans
- **Hungry Eyes** - Turkey and the Wolf folks are trying dinner. Amazing martinis. Dinner was really good too. 80s vibe wasn’t for me, but the food and drink made up for it
- **St Pizza** just opened and is getting amazing reviews. We drove past and saw lines out the door. Owner owns a great wine bar **Patron Saint** next door Closed on Mondays

  

  

## Drinks

- **Jewel of the South** - I advise avoiding Bourbon street, and the French Quarter in general, but Jewel of the South is a great exception to the rule. Just rated one of the best cocktail bars in America
- **Bar Tonique -** Near Jewel of the South. Located on the fringe of the French Quarter, what appears to be a dive bar from the outside is one of the more impressive cocktail bars I’ve ever stepped foot into.
- **Bacchanal Fine Wine & Spirits** - Get here early on a Friday evening and stake out a table outside, then spend the evening drinking wine and listening to music until its time to head to dinner.
- **Parleux Beer** - Near Bacchanal. Huge backyard (not really a yard). Decent beers. Good to combine with Bacchanal if you’re over there
- **Urban South** - Favorite brewery in New Orleans. Combine with a Turkey and the Wolf trip
- **Compere Lapin + Peacock Room** - Both good cocktail options if you find yourself in the CBD
  

## Nightlife

**Blue Nile** or anywhere on **Frenchman’s Street** for music

See who’s playing at **Tipitinas**
