With no disrespect to Cleveland, I feel this. There's truly no city in America, or anywhere else in the world, like New Orleans. It's where we go when we need a trip that feels like escaping to a

## The List

### Stay

**Hotel St. Vincent** - A fantastic way to get out of the French Quarter

### Breakfast

Willa Jean - Might be a little long in the tooth these days, but a great place to soak up the booze 

### Lunch

**Turkey and the Wolf** - one of the best lunches you’ll ever have. Fried Bologna sandwich is a top 5 sandwich of my life. Find someone to go splitty/Split on the burger (Closed Mon/Tues)

#### Po Boys 

**Parker’s** and **Domicils -** Widely regarded and debated as the two best po boys in the city. We had both and our verdict is: Yes. They’re both incredible. 

**Mothers Po Boys -** Centrally located in the CBD, usually a very long line. I believe its possible to order ahead

**Kiler Po Boys** - Po Boys with a bit of a bann mi twist

**Cochon Butcher** - Good spot for lunch if you need a break from Po Boys 

  

  

### Dinner

**Mosquito Supper Club** - This is my favorite meal in New Orleans

**Hungry Eyes** - Turkey and the Wolf folks are trying dinner. Amazing martinis. Dinner was really good too. 80s vibe wasn’t for me, but the food and drink made up for it

**St Pizza** just opened and is getting amazing reviews. We drove past and saw lines out the door. Owner owns a great wine bar **Patron Saint** next door Closed on Mondays

  

  

### Drinks

**Jewel of the South** - I advise avoiding Bourbon street, and the French Quarter in general, but Jewel of the South is a great exception to the rule. Just rated one of the best cocktail bars in America

**Bar Tonique -** Near Jewel of the South. Located on the fringe of the French Quarter, what appears to be a dive bar from the outside is one of the more impressive cocktail bars I’ve ever stepped foot into.

**Bacchanal Fine Wine & Spirits** - Get here early on a Friday evening and stake out a table outside, then spend the evening drinking wine and listening to music until its time to head to dinner.

**Parleux Beer** - Near Bacchanal. Huge backyard (not really a yard). Decent beers. Good to combine with Bacchanal if you’re over there

**Urban South** - Favorite brewery in New Orleans. Combine with a Turkey and the Wolf trip

**Compere Lapin + Peacock Room** - Great cocktails near your hotel (I prefer Compere Lapin)
  

### Nightlife

**Blue Nile** or anywhere on **Frenchman’s Street** for music

See who’s playing at **Tipitinas**
