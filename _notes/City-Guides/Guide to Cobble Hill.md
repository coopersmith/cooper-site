Since 2021, Cobble Hill has been my home. After spending more than a decade in Williamsburg, leaving was bittersweet, but felt like Peter Pan must have felt leaving Neverland. 

## If you're here for an afternoon

 **🍔 Henry Public**  
  One of, if not the best, burgers in the city. But beyond that, 

**🍸 Long Island Bar**  
I don’t spend nearly enough time here, but they’re a sneaky Wisconsin bar (complete with cheese curds) and of the best cocktail programs in the city.

 **🥯 Shelsky's**

**🍽️ La Vara**  
It’s always amazing to me that one of New York’s best restaurants 

**🍸 Elsa**  
Whenever we're out in Manhattan contemplating one more drink before calling it a night, we usually end up putting Elsa into our Lyft app and ending with a nightcap in the neighborhood.


 **🍺 Talea**
 Whatever your mental image is of a brewery/tap room, it's not this. Warm, bright
 

**📚 Books are Magic**

**🗽 Brooklyn Heights Promenade**




## If you're spending a few days in the hood

**🍔 Ingas**  
If it wasn’t for Henry Public, I’d say this is the best burger in the neighborhood. They also do a pretty solid weekend brunch

**🍽️ Colonie**  
Really great brunch, but also a great dinner spot.

**🥃 Pips**


**Sahadis**

## If you live here

**🐟 Fish Tales**  
“Fresh fish is not cheap. Cheap fish is not fresh” is the sign that greets you

**🥖 Bien Cuit**  
Saturday mornign errands usually include a stop for a few fresh loaves of whatever looks great.


**🥩 Paisanos Butcher Shop** + **🥩Dellapietras**  
I’m not sure what we did to deserve two outstanding butchers in the neighborhood, but it makes me upset I don’t have a good grill.
