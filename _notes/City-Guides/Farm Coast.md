Whether you know it as the Farm Coast, the East Bay, or something else, this idyllic stretch of New England is characterized by beautiful stone walls framing picturesque farms nestled up next to the beaches of the Atlantic ocean. 

Compromising the Tiverton Four Corners and Little Compton Rhode Island, along with Westport, 


> Beyond the natural grandeur of the East Bay, its charm further stems from a strong sense of community and a reverence for local culinary, artistic and cultural pursuits that are closely tied to the regionâ€™s fertile farmland and coastal waters. The results are farm stands galore, a flourishing arts scene and village streets lined with celebrated restaurants.

[[Westport Sea Farms]]
Nestled in amongst the lobster boats unloading todays fresh catch, you'll find Westport Sea Farms.

[[Ragged Island]]

We don't often cross over to Aquidneck Island, but when we do, its usually to visit Ragged Island Brewery. If you try to order a New England hazy here, you'll be asked which one? And you can't go wrong with any of them (though Tiny Truck is our favorite).
