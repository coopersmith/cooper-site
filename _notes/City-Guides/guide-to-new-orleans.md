> "America has only three cities: New York, San Francisco, and New Orleans. Everywhere else is Cleveland"

With no disrespect to Cleveland, I feel this. There's truly no city in America, or anywhere else in the world, like New Orleans. It's where we go when we need a trip that feels like escaping to another world entirely.

Below, please find a list of all my favorite places, as well as a suggested itinerary.

## Stay

**Hotel St. Vincent** — A fantastic way to get out of the French Quarter. This feels like the spiritual successor to the Ace, but one that matured a bit with me and values a slightly more upscale and chill vibe. The pool is absolutely fantastic, though the lounge chairs are limited and therefore competitive — some folks arrive at 8am to start reserving spots.

## Coffee and Breakfast

I'm past the age of making breakfast and brunch a destination. I'm usually looking for something quick but substantial to fuel me for whatever morning adventures we have planned.

**San Lorenzo at Hotel St. Vincent** — To that end, on our last trip, this is where we ate breakfast all four mornings. The convenience of staying and eating in the same place, combined with consistently good food, made this an easy choice.

**Willa Jean** — Might be a little long in the tooth these days, but still a great place to soak up the previous night's indulgences. The biscuits remain a standout.

**Cafe du Monde** — A New Orleans institution famous for their beignets and chicory coffee. Not exactly what I'd call breakfast, but widely beloved. Skip the crowded French Quarter location and head to the one in City Park — combine it with a visit to the New Orleans Museum of Art. Works just as well as a mid-afternoon snack.

## Lunch

**Turkey and the Wolf** — One of the best lunches you'll ever have. The fried bologna sandwich ranks in my top 5 sandwiches of all time. Find someone to split the burger with — it's substantial. *Closed Monday and Tuesday.*

### Po Boys

**Parker's and Domilise's** — Widely regarded and debated as the two best po' boy shops in the city. We tried both and our verdict is: Yes, they're both incredible. The debate is pointless — just go to whichever is more convenient.

**Mother's Po-Boys** — Centrally located in the CBD, but expect a very long line. You can order ahead to skip some of the wait.

**Killer Po Boys** — Po' boys with a banh mi twist. A modern take on the classic that actually works.

**Cochon Butcher** — A solid lunch spot when you need a break from po' boys. Their house-made charcuterie and sandwiches offer a different but equally satisfying experience.

## Dinner

**Mosquito Supper Club** — This is my favorite meal in New Orleans. Chef Melissa Martin's approach to Louisiana seafood is both authentic and innovative, creating an experience that feels both rooted in tradition and entirely fresh.

**Hungry Eyes** — The Turkey and the Wolf team's foray into dinner service. The martinis are exceptional, and the food more than lives up to their lunch reputation. The 80s aesthetic might not be for everyone, but the quality makes up for any stylistic reservations.

**St. Pizza** — The newest addition to the scene, already generating amazing reviews and lines out the door. The owner also runs **Patron Saint**, an excellent wine bar next door. *Closed Mondays.*

## Drinks

**Jewel of the South** — I generally advise avoiding Bourbon Street and the French Quarter, but Jewel of the South is a brilliant exception to the rule (and it's just 20 feet from the edge of the Quarter). Recently rated one of the best cocktail bars in America, and for good reason.

**Bar Tonique** — Near Jewel of the South on the fringe of the French Quarter, what appears to be a dive bar from the outside is actually one of the more impressive cocktail bars I've ever experienced. The contrast between exterior and interior makes the discovery even more satisfying.

**Bacchanal Fine Wine & Spirits** — Arrive early on a Friday evening to stake out a table in their magical backyard, then spend the evening drinking wine and listening to live music until it's time for dinner. The atmosphere is unmatched.

**Parleaux Beer Lab** — Near Bacchanal with a huge outdoor space (calling it a "yard" would be generous). Decent beers and perfect for combining with a Bacchanal visit if you're in the area.

**Urban South Brewery** — My favorite brewery in New Orleans. The location makes it easy to combine with a Turkey and the Wolf lunch.

**Compère Lapin and Peacock Room** — Both excellent cocktail options if you find yourself in the CBD. Sophisticated drinks in a more upscale setting.

## Nightlife

**Blue Nile** — The standout venue on Frenchman Street, though anywhere along this strip will deliver authentic New Orleans music. Skip Bourbon Street's tourist traps and head here for the real thing.

**Tipitina's** — Check who's playing at this legendary venue. When there's a good show, it's absolutely worth the trip.

## Culture & Sightseeing

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/NewOrleans/©CooperLiskaSmith_20190331_155120_3stars_.jpeg" alt="New Orleans culture"/>

**Second Line Parades** — If you're lucky enough to be in town on a Sunday, seek out one of the weekly second line parades. These traditional processions, organized by various social clubs, invite spontaneous participation as they wind through different neighborhoods. Check local listings for times and locations.

**New Orleans Museum of Art** — Located in City Park, this is an excellent cultural stop that pairs perfectly with a visit to the Cafe du Monde location in the same area.

**Magazine Street** — A lengthy stretch perfect for wandering, shopping, and people-watching. The street runs through several distinct neighborhoods, each with its own character.

**The Bywater** — An up-and-coming neighborhood worth exploring for its colorful shotgun houses and local character. Bacchanal is located here, making it a natural pairing.

## Sample Itinerary

### Friday
**Morning:** Catch a Friday morning flight that gets you in around lunchtime. Grab a Lyft (they're very affordable here) straight to your hotel.

**Afternoon:** Check into **Hotel St. Vincent** and drop your bags, but don't linger. Take a short walk down Magazine Street and make your way to **Turkey and the Wolf**. The fried bologna sandwich is absolutely non-negotiable.

**Evening:** After lunch, explore the Magazine Street area before heading back to the hotel to freshen up. For dinner, if you can get a reservation, **Mosquito Supper Club** should be your first choice. End the night with cocktails at **Jewel of the South**.

### Saturday
**Morning:** Breakfast at **San Lorenzo** in your hotel, then head to City Park for **Cafe du Monde** beignets and a visit to the **New Orleans Museum of Art**.

**Afternoon:** Explore the **Bywater** neighborhood and claim a table at **Bacchanal** for an afternoon of wine and music.

**Evening:** Dinner at **Hungry Eyes** or **St. Pizza**, followed by live music on **Frenchman Street**.

### Sunday
**Morning:** Check if there's a **Second Line Parade** happening — if so, this should be your priority. If not, explore more of Magazine Street or the Garden District.

**Afternoon:** Po' boy comparison at both **Parker's** and **Domilise's** (yes, both).

**Evening:** Final dinner and drinks, savoring your last night in this incredible city.
