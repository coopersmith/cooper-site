Tennessee Williams

With no disrespect to Cleveland, I feel this. There's truly no city in America, or anywhere else in the world, like New Orleans. It's where we go when we need a trip that feels like escaping to a

## Stay

**Hotel St. Vincent**  
A fantastic way to get out of the French Quarter. This feels like the spiritual successor the Ace, but one that matured a bit with me and values a slightly more upscale and chill vibe. Absolutely fantastic pool, though the lounge chairs are a bit limited and therefore competitive (some folks get there at 8am to start reserving). 

## Coffee and Breakfast

I'm past the age of making breakfast/brunch a destination. I'm usually looking for something quick, but substantial, to fuel me for whatever morning adventures we have planned.

**San Lorenzo at Hotel St. Vincent**  
To that end, on our last trip, this is where we ate 4/4 of our breakfasts. 



**Willa Jean**  
Might be a little long in the tooth these days, but a great place to soak up the booze¬†

**Cafe du Monde**  
A New Orleans institution for their beignets. Not exactly what I would call breakfast, but widely popular. Avoid the one in the French Quarter and head to the one in City Park, combined with a visit to the New Orleans Museum of Art. Hits just as well as a mid afternoon snack.

## Lunch

**Turkey and the Wolf** - one of the best lunches you‚Äôll ever have. Fried Bologna sandwich is a top 5 sandwich of my life. Find someone to go splitty/split on the burger (Closed Mon/Tues)

### Po Boys 

**Parker‚Äôs** and **Domicils -** Widely regarded and debated as the two best po boys in the city. We had both and our verdict is: Yes. They‚Äôre both incredible.¬†

**Mothers Po Boys -** Centrally located in the CBD, usually a very long line. I believe its possible to order ahead

**Kiler Po Boys** - Po Boys with a bit of a bann mi twist

**Cochon Butcher** - Good spot for lunch if you need a break from Po Boys 

  

  

## Dinner

- **Mosquito Supper Club** - This is my favorite meal in New Orleans
- **Hungry Eyes** - Turkey and the Wolf folks are trying dinner. Amazing martinis. Dinner was really good too. 80s vibe wasn‚Äôt for me, but the food and drink made up for it
- **St Pizza** just opened and is getting amazing reviews. We drove past and saw lines out the door. Owner owns a great wine bar **Patron Saint** next door Closed on Mondays

  

  

## Drinks

**Jewel of the South**  
I advise avoiding Bourbon street, and the French Quarter in general, but Jewel of the South is a great exception to the rule (and its 20 feet from the edge of the Quarter.) Just rated one of the best cocktail bars in America

**Bar Tonique**   
Near Jewel of the South. Located on the fringe of the French Quarter, what appears to be a dive bar from the outside is one of the more impressive cocktail bars I‚Äôve ever stepped foot into.

**Bacchanal Fine Wine & Spirits**  
Get here early on a Friday evening and stake out a table outside, then spend the evening drinking wine and listening to music until its time to head to dinner.

**Parleux Beer** 
Near Bacchanal. Huge backyard (not really a yard). Decent beers. Good to combine with Bacchanal if you‚Äôre over there

**Urban South** - Favorite brewery in New Orleans. Combine with a Turkey and the Wolf trip

**Compere Lapin + Peacock Room** - Both good cocktail options if you find yourself in the CBD
  

## Nightlife

**Blue Nile** or anywhere on **Frenchman‚Äôs Street** for music

See who‚Äôs playing at **Tipitinas**
