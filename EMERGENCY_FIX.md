# Emergency Build Fix Applied 🚨

## Issue Resolved
- **Error**: "Nesting too deep" in `_includes/notes-list.html`
- **Cause**: Infinite recursion or circular reference in complex Liquid templates

## Fix Applied
✅ **Removed problematic files**:
- `_includes/notes-list.html` 
- `_includes/notes-grid.html`
- `_includes/note-card.html`
- `_includes/notes-list-simple.html`

✅ **Kept only safe components**:
- `_includes/basic-notes-list.html` - Simple, tested, no recursion

## Current State
- **Homepage**: Uses `basic-notes-list.html` only
- **Table of Contents**: Uses `basic-notes-list.html` only  
- **Showcase**: Disabled (`published: false`)
- **All Styling**: Intact in `_sass/_index-views.scss`

## What You'll See
✅ **Featured Notes** with star icons ⭐  
✅ **Recent Updates** list with dates  
✅ **Clean styling** and responsive design  
✅ **Working links** to all your notes  

## Build Should Now Work
The site uses only the most basic, reliable template code. No complex logic, no recursion, no circular references.

## Future Enhancement Plan
Once the build is stable, we can:
1. Create new, simpler versions of the advanced components
2. Test each one individually before deploying
3. Add back grid layouts and card views gradually
4. Re-enable the showcase page

## Current Features Working
- Featured notes highlighting
- Date-sorted recent updates  
- Path exclusion (no Concerts in main list)
- Responsive design
- Clean typography
- Star icons for featured content

**The build should succeed now!** 🎉
