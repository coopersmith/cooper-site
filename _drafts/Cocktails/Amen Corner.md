- 3/4 ounce [[amaro]], preferably [[Amaro Nonino]]
- 4 to 5 [[mint leaves]]

## Notes

Ever since the [[Paper Plane]] first took flight, itâ€™s landed on menus across the country, sometimes in its original form, but more often than not in modified states that, taken together, chart the progression from a classic to a modern classic to an ever-expanding family of riffs. The evolution continues with the Amen Corner. Created by PDT alum Nick Brown, the bourbon-based cocktail simply ditches the lemon juice from the original, tweaks the ratios and adds a burst of freshly muddled mint.
