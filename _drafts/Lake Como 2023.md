In late summer 2023, we took a family trip to Northern Italy for the Monza F1 race. 

While the purpose of the trip was obviously the race itself, spending a week in an absolutely incredible villa overlooking Lake Como with our niece, nephew, and the rest of the family was such an amazing experience. The villa we rented was on the less touristy eastern side of the lake, with much smaller towns and winding roads. To get anywhere required a 20-30 minute walk to the nearest town of Torno.
