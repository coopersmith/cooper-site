Sometime in the mid 2010s, Newfoundland hired a bunch of then influencers* to travel to different parts of Newfoundland and photograph their trips with the hopes of inspiring tourism. I can with certainty that it boosted tourism by at least 2, as it inspired my then partner and I to pack our bags (and cameras) and drive around Newfoundland over Labor Day weekend in 2015. We started in St. Johnâ€™s, traced the eastern coast up to ____, and took the ferry over to Fogo Island to explore the various artist residencies and the absolutely incredible Fogo Island Inn.
