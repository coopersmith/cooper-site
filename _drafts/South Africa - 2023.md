One of the best decisions we made around our wedding was to differ our honeymoon one year. Rather than needing to plan both simultaneously, we focused solely on our wedding, and then turned our focus to a two week trip to South Africa, which landed on our one year anniversay. 

## Capetown

We spent the first few days of our trip in Capetown, staying at the incredible [[The Silo Hotel]]. Though we had a blast exploring the city, going to the top of Table Mountain, and eating amazing meals, the highlight of our time was undoubtedly our adventure tour out to the Cape of Good Hope.
