Its easy to write this with a bit of hindsight, but in 2017 I was in a bit of a funk as my 32nd birthday approached. At the last minute, on a Sunday evening, I booked a Thursday morning plane ticket to Mexico City for a solo trip to explore. With only a few days notice, I didn't have time to overthink or overplan, other than securing a dinner reservation at Pujol. Instead, I just hopped on a plane and explored an incredible city. And as it turned out, my friend Prachi was doing something similar, so we met up for a day of exploration as well.
