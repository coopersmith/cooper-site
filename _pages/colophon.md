# Colophon

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Its written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) and started from the [aaaaaa](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.

Unless otherwise noted, all images are captured by me, often with a Leica camera including the [M10](https://www.leica-camera.com/en/product/m10-rangefinder-camera), [Q3](https://www.leica-camera.com/en/product/q3-compact-mirrorless-camera), and [M7](https://www.leica-camera.com/en/product/m7-rangefinder-camera).
