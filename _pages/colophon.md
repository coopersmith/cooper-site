# Colophon

I'm not quite sure what this website is, but the closest notion is that of a digital garden. But more importantly for me, its a [home cooked meal](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/?__readwiseLocation=). Perhaps its also [a complex search query to find fascinating people and make them route interesting stuff to your inbox](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/search-query?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Its written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) and started from the [aaaaaa](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.

Unless otherwise noted, all images are captured by me, often with a Leica camera including the [M10](https://www.leica-camera.com/en/product/m10-rangefinder-camera), [Q3](https://www.leica-camera.com/en/product/q3-compact-mirrorless-camera), and [M7](https://www.leica-camera.com/en/product/m7-rangefinder-camera). Film photos are either taken on a Leica M7, Mamiya 7II, or Contax T2, and are almost always shot on Kodak film, usually Portra 400.

The font is [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) because of course.
