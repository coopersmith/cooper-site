### 2023
## South Africa
In order to give ourselves more space to plan both our wedding and honeymoon, we decided early on to do our honeymoon on our one year anniversary. We travelled to South Africa, spending several days in Capetown, headed west to wine country, and then hopped on a plane for the most incredible four days of safari.
