# Hey, I'm Cooper


I'm a Director of Product Design at Asana. I have over a decade of experience building products and teams at Lyft, Twitter, Foursquare [among others](https://read.cv/coops). 

I also run a small micro-roastery called [Farm Coast Coffee](https://farmcoastcoffee.com/).

I split my time between Brooklyn, NY and our 1754 farmhouse on the [Rhode Island Farm Coast.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/travel/east-bay-rhode-island.html)

I'm rarely without a camera, and share my adventures on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/coopersmith) and [Glass](https://glass.photo/coop).
