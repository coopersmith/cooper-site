This is my collection of ephemeraâ€”those fleeting, everyday artifacts that tell the story of a life lived. From ticket stubs and handwritten notes to photographs and found objects, each piece represents a moment worth preserving.

These items come from my personal archive, digitized and catalogued to share the beauty found in the temporary and overlooked.
