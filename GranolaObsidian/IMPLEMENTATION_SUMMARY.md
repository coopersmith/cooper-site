# Implementation Summary: Automatic Backlinks Feature (COO-95)

## Overview
This implementation adds automatic backlink functionality to the Granola Obsidian plugin, fulfilling the requirements specified in Linear issue COO-95.

## Requirements Implemented

### 1. Automatic Person Name Linking ✅
**Requirement**: "Anytime a person is mentioned in the note, I'd like to wrap it like this [[Firstname Lastname]]"

**Implementation**:
- Extracts person names from meeting attendees using existing email-to-name mapping
- Automatically searches note content for these names
- Wraps any occurrence in `[[Firstname Lastname]]` format
- Respects existing links (won't double-link)
- Uses word boundaries for accurate matching
- Works seamlessly with the existing email-to-name mapping feature

### 2. Configurable Topic Linking ✅
**Requirement**: "I'd like the plugin settings to have an area where I could enter topics that automatically get linked on import. I imagine this to be an input box of comma separated strings where I could say 'TopicA, Topic B, Topic C, Long Topic D' etc."

**Implementation**:
- Added new "Linkable Topics" setting in plugin configuration
- Uses a textarea input for comma-separated topic list
- Example: "Product Strategy, Team Sync, Q4 Planning, Long Topic Name"
- Automatically wraps any occurrence of configured topics in `[[Topic]]` format
- Case-insensitive matching to catch variations
- Preserves original text casing in the link
- Sorts topics by length (longest first) to avoid partial matches

## Technical Details

### Code Changes
1. **Interface Updates** (lines 3-10, 12-19)
   - Added `linkableTopics: string` to `GranolaPluginSettings` interface
   - Added default value in `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`

2. **Core Processing Function** (lines 420-491)
   - New `addBacklinks()` method handles both people and topic linking
   - Two-step process:
     - Step 1: Link person names from attendees
     - Step 2: Link configured topics
   - Smart regex matching with lookbehind/lookahead to avoid double-linking
   - Context checking to ensure links aren't already present

3. **Settings UI** (lines ~740-755)
   - Added textarea input for topic configuration
   - Helpful description text explaining the feature
   - Auto-saves changes to plugin settings

### Integration Point
- The `addBacklinks()` method is called in `processDocument()` after markdown conversion but before the frontmatter is added
- This ensures all content is processed while maintaining the document structure

### Safety Features
- Won't link text already in `[[brackets]]`
- Uses word boundaries to avoid partial word matches
- Escapes special regex characters in names/topics
- Handles edge cases like names with special characters

## Testing
- Plugin builds successfully with TypeScript compilation
- No linter errors
- Build output: main.js (24KB)

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. Update plugin settings in Obsidian
2. Navigate to Settings → Granola Notes Sync → Linkable Topics
3. Enter comma-separated topics (e.g., "Product Strategy, Team Sync, Q4 Planning")
4. Sync notes as usual
5. Person names and topics will automatically be linked

### Example
**Input note content:**
```
We discussed Product Strategy with John Smith and Jane Doe.
The Team Sync will happen next week.
```

**With settings:**
- Attendees: john.smith@company.com, jane.doe@company.com
- Linkable Topics: "Product Strategy, Team Sync"

**Output:**
```
We discussed [[Product Strategy]] with [[John Smith]] and [[Jane Doe]].
The [[Team Sync]] will happen next week.
```

## Files Modified
- `main.ts` - Added backlinks functionality (~80 lines of new code)
- `README.md` - Updated with feature documentation
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Documented the changes
- All files successfully compiled and built

## Next Steps
This implementation is complete and ready for use. The plugin now:
1. ✅ Automatically links person mentions by default
2. ✅ Allows configurable topic linking via settings
3. ✅ Preserves existing links and avoids double-linking
4. ✅ Works with both short and long topic names with spaces
