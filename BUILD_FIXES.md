# Build Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. **Liquid Template Syntax Errors**
- **Problem**: Using `where: "tags", filter_tag` doesn't work with arrays in Jekyll
- **Fix**: Changed to manual loop with `contains` operator for tag filtering
- **Files**: `_includes/notes-grid.html`, `_includes/notes-list.html`

### 2. **Complex Conditional Logic**
- **Problem**: Checking `filtered_notes.first.last_modified_at` was causing build failures
- **Fix**: Simplified to always use `last_modified_at_timestamp` sorting
- **Files**: `_includes/notes-grid.html`, `_includes/notes-list.html`

### 3. **Fallback Implementation**
- **Created**: Simple fallback components to ensure builds work
- **Files**: 
  - `_includes/basic-notes-list.html` - Minimal working version
  - `_includes/notes-list-simple.html` - Intermediate version

## Current State

### Working Components
✅ `_includes/basic-notes-list.html` - Simple, reliable list  
✅ `_includes/note-card.html` - Individual note cards  
✅ `_sass/_index-views.scss` - All styling  

### Fixed Components (Need Testing)
🔄 `_includes/notes-grid.html` - Grid layout with fixes  
🔄 `_includes/notes-list.html` - Advanced list with fixes  

### Temporarily Disabled
❌ `_pages/showcase.md` - Set to `published: false`  

## Current Homepage Implementation

The homepage now uses the basic fallback component:

```liquid
{% comment %} Featured Notes {% endcomment %}
{% assign featured_notes = site.notes | where: "featured", true %}
{% if featured_notes.size > 0 %}
  {% include basic-notes-list.html 
     notes=featured_notes 
     title="Featured Notes" 
     limit=3 %}
{% endif %}

{% comment %} Recent Updates {% endcomment %}
{% include basic-notes-list.html 
   notes=site.notes 
   title="Recently Updated" 
   subtitle="My latest thoughts and explorations"
   limit=5 
   exclude_path="Concerts" 
   show_more_link="/tableofcontents" 
   show_more_text="notes" %}
```

## Next Steps

### 1. **Test the Build**
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### 2. **If Build Succeeds**
- Gradually re-enable the advanced components
- Test `notes-list-simple.html` first
- Then try `notes-grid.html` and `notes-list.html`
- Re-enable showcase page

### 3. **If Build Still Fails**
- Check Jekyll logs for specific errors
- May need to further simplify the Liquid logic
- Consider using plugins or different approaches

## Key Changes Made

1. **Tag Filtering**: Changed from `where` filter to manual loops
2. **Sorting**: Simplified to always use timestamp sorting  
3. **Error Handling**: Added more defensive checks
4. **Fallbacks**: Created simple backup implementations
5. **Styling**: Added basic styling for fallback components

## Features Preserved

- ✅ Featured notes functionality (`featured: true`)
- ✅ Tag display and filtering
- ✅ Date sorting by last modified
- ✅ Path exclusion (e.g., excluding Concerts)
- ✅ Responsive design and styling
- ✅ Clean typography and visual hierarchy

The build should now work with basic functionality, and you can progressively enhance from there.
