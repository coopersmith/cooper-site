# Dynamic 2025 Media Diet Page

## What I've Built

âœ… **Dynamic 2025 Reading List** at `/2025-reading-list/`  
âœ… **Removed dashes** from note lists (cleaner date styling)  
âœ… **Auto-updating content** that pulls from your actual notes  
âœ… **Beautiful card-based design** with status indicators  
âœ… **Statistics dashboard** showing your progress  

## How It Works

The page automatically finds and displays content based on your existing tagging system:

### Books
- **Currently Reading**: Notes with `books` + `MediaDiet2025` tags + `start` date but no `end` date
- **Completed**: Notes with `books` + `MediaDiet2025` tags + `end` date
- **Shows**: Title, author, rating, start/end dates

### Movies  
- **Finds**: Notes with `movies` + `MediaDiet2025` tags
- **Shows**: Title, director, year, rating, watch date

### TV Shows
- **Finds**: Notes with `tv`/`television` + `MediaDiet2025` tags  
- **Shows**: Title, creator, season, rating, watch date
